1. This edit is manual.. one by one string

2. Download the poedit from : https://poedit.net, Install on your PC

3. On your theme directory create a folder named: languages
So, in functions.php you should have:
load_theme_textdomain( "philosophy", get_theme_file_path('/languages') ); //"philosophy->text domain"
in after_setup_theme hook!

4. Open PO Edit software > File > New > English (Default Language) and "save" to your theme root directory > languages - folder! Save as "en_US.po" as default english!

5. Configure po edit softwar > Catelog> Properties > Source path > "Show the theme root directory"
Also, Exclude paths like assets folder (css/js) / Markup. 

Then, Catalog > Update from source > Save! (So, All string will save into "en_US.po" from theme root directory!)

** po edit should translate only .php file so exclude rest file formats path!

6. You can copy the "en_US.po" and save as "theme-domain.pot" (pot is the main translatable file format)
So, Now we can copy this and save as "bn_BN.po" to translate the website! 

** So, bn_BN.mo will create automatically as php only read .mo file. .po file for future edit!

So, tranlatable file will only work when your website call that file from language option.
If we want to work the "bn_BN.po" so we have to save admin dashboard > setting > general > language > bangla!

We can see all the internation language format here: https://wpcentral.io/internationalization/
